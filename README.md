# hello-world
interested in creating a crypto currency with decentralized mining
Originally from a small town in New York State on the border of canada. Self taught network engineer, and systems administrator for linux and windows. Back from a very very long Hiatus, about a decade. Began with a couple years in India then Israel and I haven't been the same since. More soon. This is an idea i just thought of today in the face of the segwit issue and the glaring reality that a single mining collective can take control of any coin dependent on miners.
I'm thinking something like a wallet background process always running when your wallet is, during which time you earn a certain percentage, like a savings account.
